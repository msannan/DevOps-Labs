# Agile vs DevOps
  DevOps is a practice of bringing development and operations teams together whereas Agile is an iterative approach that focuses on collaboration, customer feedback and small rapid releases.

# Define CI, Continuous Delivery & Continuous Deployment 
### Continuous Integration (CI):
    is a DevOps software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, after which automated builds and tests are run.
### Continuous Delivery (CD):
    Continuous delivery is a software development practice where code changes are automatically prepared for a release to staging (non production environment). Continuous delivery lets developers automate testing beyond just unit tests so they can verify application updates across multiple dimensions before deploying to customers.
### Continuous Deployment:
    Continuous deployment is a software development practice where code changes are automatically prepared for a release to production without any manual intervention

# Difference b/w Git & Github
  Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.
# Stages of Git
   Files in a repository go through three stages before being under version control with git:

   - Untracked: the file exists, but is not part of git's version control
   - Staged: the file has been added to git's version control but changes have not been committed
   - Committed: the change has been committed
# methods of git reset?
  - --soft: uncommit changes, changes are left staged (index).
  - --mixed (default): uncommit + unstage changes, changes are left in working tree.
  - --hard: uncommit + unstage + delete changes, nothing left.
